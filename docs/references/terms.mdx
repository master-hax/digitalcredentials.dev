# Terms

## Cross-Device Issuance (CDI)

## Cross-Device Presentation (CDP)

Cross-Device Presentation (CDP) allows a verifiable digital credential from one device to be used on another device. For example, your phone can be linked to your laptop, allowing you to use a digital credential from an identity wallet on your phone with a site/service on your laptop.

CDP is powered by the FIDO Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) using â€œhybrid transports". CTAP is implemented by authenticators and client platforms, not Issuers or Verifiers.
